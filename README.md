# AIX-for-Penetration-Testers
This repository contains a basic AIX system enumeration guide for penetration testers/red teamers.

The original guide can be found in this blog-post:
https://thevivi.net/2017/03/19/aix-for-penetration-testers/

A few people asked me to turn the blog-post into a repository, so here it is.
Any contributions are more than welcome.
